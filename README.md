# Innovation Tech:
With this simple page, you can search for a city, in a database that includes the best cities in the world, to evaluate its characteristics and choose your next place where you are going to live.

## :question: Why
This project is the final practice for start2impact Javascript Advanced course.<br>
Created in the early 2022, this is my second JS project.

## :bulb: How it works
Start writing the city you are looking for in the main search bar and check the cities available in the suggestions. <br> <br>

Once selected you can start the search and you will see a photo, description and scores of the searched city in a simple nice graph. <br>
If you want to compare the scores with those of another city, you can select one to add to the graph and make your comparison.
